/**
 * The Remote interface serves to identify interfaces whose methods may be invoked
 * from a CAD client application. An object that is a remote object must directly
 * or indirectly implement this interface. Only those methods specified in a
 * "remote interface", an interface that extends java.rmi.Remote are available remotely.
 *
 * Implementation classes can implement any number of remote interfaces and can extend
 * other remote implementation classes. Java Card RMI provides a convenience class
 * called javacard.framework.service.CardRemoteObject that remote object
 * implementations can extend which facilitates remote object creation.
 * For complete details on Java Card RMI, see the <I>Java Card Runtime Environment
 * Specification</I> and the <CODE>javacard.framework.service</CODE> API package.
