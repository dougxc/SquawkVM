/**
 * A JCRE owned instance of <code>NullPointerException</code>is thrown when an applet attempts
 * to use <code>null</code> in a case where an object is required. These include:<p><ul>
 * <li> Calling the instance method of a <code>null</code> object. 
 * <li> Accessing or modifying the field of a <code>null</code> object. 
 * <li> Taking the length of <code>null</code> as if it were an array. 
 * <li> Accessing or modifying the slots of <code>null</code> as if it were an array. 
 * <li> Throwing <code>null</code> as if it were a <code>Throwable</code> value.
 * </ul>
 * <p>JCRE owned instances of exception classes are temporary JCRE Entry Point Objects
 * and can be accessed from any applet context. References to these temporary objects
 * cannot be stored in class variables or instance variables or array components.
 * See <em>Java Card Runtime Environment (JCRE) Specification</em>, section 6.2.1 for details.
 * <p>This Java Card class's functionality is a strict subset of the definition in the 
 * <em>Java Platform Core API Specification</em>.<p>
