1, The Phi merging is wrong. Firstly it only allows a delta of one element to be on the stack
   when the between the start of a BB and the Phi. Also it only works when the Phi is at an
   address higher than all the branches. The solution is for the Phi to contain a two dimensional array
   of instruction predecessor pointers so that every stack element from ereny brack point is known, and
   then have all subsequent branches rename their instructions to use the type of the first branch.

   Actually even easier, just remember the virtual register numbers on the stack of the first
   branch and set all subsequent branches to use those registers.


2, Have one invoke type not two

3, Unload <clinit> after execution, then this is a good place to build tables e.g.
       static int[] foo = {1,2,3,4};
   is better than
       int[] foo = {1,2,3,4};
